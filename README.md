# Explorers

This is meant to be a web game where you control a character exploring the
world.

## Goals
The goal is to use this project as a test of a set of Javascript tools.

The project needs to be complex enough as to evaluate the tools in a close to
real-world scenario. 

The game avoids the use of the canvas element as the tools to be tested are
focused on HTML/CSS/Javascript development.

The game will avoid as much as possible the use of any tooling outside of the
browser environment.

The game will avoid as much as possible any tool that is not under test.

## Tools under test

The tools are assumed to exist in a sibling folder called tools.
Symbolic links are used to invoke the tools
